# Welcome to Arig

Arig a desert planet with limited resources, a hot place with vast deserts where valuable resources can only be found underground or in the sand. Constant sandstorms make the use of robots unviable, and most of the surface is unsuitable for building without a proper foundation.

# Planetaris unbounded

Planetaris unbounded is a bigger mod that merges all planetaris planets, Arig works on its own but is recommended to play with the rest of planets.

I'm completely open to suggestions and ideas. :)
